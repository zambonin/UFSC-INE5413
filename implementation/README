A simple digraph implementation in Python that contains a depth-first search
algorithm, used to check if a graph is a tree. A document consisting of time
complexities of all the methods is also included.

The doublets word transformation puzzle, created by Lewis Carroll (of Alice in
Wonderland fame), can be modeled as a graph depth-first search. Its rules are
simple: given two words with the same length, one must connect them through
"links", which are simply one-letter changes that must produce valid words.

A Python implementation using a heap queue is provided as a proof of concept.
With a dictionary file in hands, one may use it as following:

    $ python doublets.py /path/to/dict word1 word2
